# Voice Activity Detection Toolkit
This toolkit provides the voice activity detection (VAD) code and our recorded dataset.
## Introduction

VAD toolkit in this project was used in the paper: 

Juntae Kim, Minsoo Hahan: "Voice Activity Detection Based on the Adaptive Context Attention Model (ACAM)", submitted paper, 2017.

ACAM is based on the recurrent attention model (RAM) [1] and the implementation of RAM can be found in [jlindsey15](https://github.com/jlindsey15/RAM) and [jtkim-kaist](https://github.com/jtkim-kaist/ram_modified)'s repository.

The submitted paper will be provided as soon as it is accepted. If you want to use this toolkit before publishing the paper, please cite this repositoy like: 

Juntae Kim: "VAD_Toolkit", GitHub repository, [Online] Available: https://github.com/jtkim-kaist/VAD_Toolkit, 2017.

VAD in this toolkit follows the procedure as below:

#### Acoustic feature extraction

In this toolkit, we use the multi-resolution cochleagram (MRCG) [2] for the acoustic feature implemented by matlab.
Note that MRCG extraction time is relatively long compared to the classifier.
#### Classifier

This toolkit supports 4 types of MRCG based classifer implemented by python with tensorflow as follows:
1. Adaptive context attention model (ACAM)
2. Boosted deep neural network (bDNN) [2]
3. Deep neural network (DNN) [2] 
4. Long short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) [3]

## Prerequisites

- Python 3

- Tensorflow 1.1-3

- Matlab 2017b
## Example

The example matlab script is `main.m`. Just run it on the matlab.
The result will be like following figure. 

Note: To apply this toolkit to other speech data, the speech data should be sampled with 16kHz sampling frequency.

## Recorded Dataset
Our recored dataset is freely available: 
[Download](http://sail.ipdisk.co.kr:80/publist/VOL1/Database/VAD_DB/Recorded_data.zip)


#### Specification
- Environments

>Bus stop, construction site, park, and room.

- Recording device

>A smart phone (Samsung Galaxy S8)

At each environment, conversational speech by two Korean male speakers was recorded. The ground truth labels are manually annotated. Because the recording was carried out in the real world, unexpected noises are included to the dataset such as the crying of baby, the chirping of insects, mouse click sound, and etc. The details of dataset is described in the following table:


|               | Bus stop      | Cons. site    | Park          | Room          | Overall       |
| :------------ | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Dur. (min)    | 30.02         | 30.03         | 30.07         | 30.05         | 120.17        |
| Avg. SNR (dB) | 5.61          | 2.05          | 5.71          | 18.26         | 7.91          |
| % of speech   | 40.12         | 26.71         | 26.85         | 30.44         | 31.03         |
